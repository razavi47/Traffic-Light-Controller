# Traffic-Light-Controller
A fully synchronous, state-driven traffic light controller using Verilog on the Intel DE10-Lite FPGA. The system cycles through North-South and East-West intersections through Green → Yellow → Red, with accurately timed intervals. LED indicators visualize the active lights, while a 7-segment HEX display outputs real-time states.:
